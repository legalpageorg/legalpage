Because creating a legal page sucks.

## How?
Follow these steps to add a legal page to your project.

### 1. Fork this repository
https://github.com/legalpageorg/legalpage
![](https://static.legalpage.org/images/baseline_info_black_18dp.png) Make sure your repository is public. 

### 2. Verify ownership of your domain
Every legal page is bound to a domain.   
To verify that you own your domain create a TXT record that points to your legal page repository.   
Host: legalpage   
Value: YOUR REPOSITORY URL (eg. https://github.com/legalpageorg/legalpage)

### 3. Modify the .md and the config.yaml files
You can freely modify the templates and even add additional pages to your legal page.
