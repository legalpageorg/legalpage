## What?

Legalpage.org is a fully hosted web service to host your privacy, terms, imprint, and cookie pages (legal pages).  
At the base of every legal page are markdown files. We have added a very simple placeholder syntax and a config.yaml file which can be used to customize the pages to your needs.
Let's build an ecosystem of template files that fit every use case.  

## Why?

* Because creating a legal page sucks. 😜
* Host a good-looking legal page in seconds.
* Community-maintained templates.
* Give your user full transparency on updates.

## How?
Follow these steps to create your legal page.

### 1. Fork this repository
https://github.com/legalpageorg/legalpage
💁‍♀️ Make sure your repository is public. 

### 2. Verify ownership of your domain
Every legal page is bound to a domain.   
To verify that you own your domain create a TXT record that points to your legal page repository.   

Host: legalpage   
Value: YOUR REPOSITORY URL (eg. https://github.com/legalpageorg/legalpage)

### 3. Modify the .md and the config.yaml files
You can freely modify the templates and even add additional pages and placeholders to your legal page.
