## Why?

## How?
Follow these steps to create your legal page.

### 1. Fork this repository
https://github.com/legalpageorg/legalpage
💁‍♀️ Make sure your repository is public. 

### 2. Verify ownership of your domain
Every legal page is bound to a domain.   
To verify that you own your domain create a TXT record that points to your legal page repository.   

Host: legalpage   
Value: YOUR REPOSITORY URL (eg. https://github.com/legalpageorg/legalpage)
